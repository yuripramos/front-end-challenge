## :octocat: Getting Started
This is an app that shows "The Destiny" game, when you can play Tarot. Rules as much simple as possible
1 - Click on the start button, the cards will be shuffled and flipped.
2 - Click in one card, you can choose only one per click.
3 - The game ends when there's no card left on the table.
