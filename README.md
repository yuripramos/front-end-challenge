## :octocat: Getting Started
This is an app that shows "The Destiny" game, when you can play Tarot. Rules as much simple as possible <br/>
1 - Click on the start button, the cards will be shuffled and flipped. <br/>
2 - Click in one card, you can choose only one per click. <br/>
3 - After the click your card will be flipped and you can see the infos about it. <br/>
4 - If you click in one card with another one already flipped the default action is to unflip this one.
